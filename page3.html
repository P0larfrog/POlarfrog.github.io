  <center><p><h1>MY CAT</h1></center> <center><h2>my son name is pepe, he is a muted cat—he doesn't meow or anything but he is trying to meow but no voice will be heard
    that's how we realised he's muted. Pepe's mother is the cat I found in the chapel, I am amazed that she is black and her mom isn't so i adopted her but then.... her true colors 
    ay lumalabas na. She's so pasaway and nagnanakaw ng ulam; so my dad is mad at her xD then she gaved birth to my laloves "pepe"

                  pepe has 2 siblings and that 2 is now gone, i think it is because of their dad

                  so much blood because nahulog siya sa hagdan.</h2>
